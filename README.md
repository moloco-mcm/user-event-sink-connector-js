# User Event Sink Connector for Javascript (Reference Implementation)

This repository contains a reference implementation for processing and handling user events in TypeScript. It demonstrates best practices for event validation, processing, and type safety.

> **Note**: This is a reference implementation intended as a starting point for your own implementation. It is not meant to be used as a library dependency.

## Purpose

This reference implementation demonstrates:
- Type-safe event validation patterns
- Event data filtering techniques
- Distinguishes between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
- Implements exponential backoff for transient failures
- Starts with 100ms delay, doubles after each attempt
- Limits maximum retries to prevent infinite loops
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

This pattern is particularly useful for:
- Handling network instability
- Managing rate limits
- Dealing with temporary service unavailability

## Implementation Examples

### Event Data Validation and Sending
```typescript
import { UserEventSinkConnector } from 'user-event-sink-connector';

const platformId = process.env.PLATFORM_ID;
const apiHostname = process.env.API_HOSTNAME;
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

const connector = new UserEventSinkConnector(platformId, apiHostname, apiKey);
await connector.send({
  userId: '123',
  eventType: 'purchase',
  items: [{id: '456', price: 99.99}]
});
```

## Error Handling & Retry Strategy
This implementation demonstrates best practices for handling API errors with exponential backoff:

### Error Types
- **SyntaxError**: Thrown when response parsing fails. These errors are immediately thrown as they indicate a fundamental problem that won't be resolved by retrying.
- **Other Errors**: Network issues, rate limits, etc. These are handled with retries.

### Retry Strategy
```typescript
const maxRetries = 3; // Maximum retry attempts
let waitTime = 100; // Initial wait time (0.1 seconds)
try {
    await connector.send(event);
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof SyntaxError) {
        throw error; // Don't retry parsing errors
    }
    // Exponential backoff for other errors
    waitTime = 2; // Doubles wait time each attempt
    // 1st retry: 100ms
    // 2nd retry: 200ms
    // 3rd retry: 400ms
}
```
